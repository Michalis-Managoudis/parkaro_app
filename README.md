## Abstract

This diploma thesis presents the design and implementation, which gathers parking services
on one platform, with the aim of facilitating the user in the search of finding a parking space
by providing him with all available options, gathered in one place, and secondly a
management, of the parking space locally, with the aim of automating the processes and
maintaining customer databases on the business side.

The application uses web programming technologies and manages map and date data as
well as a sensor used to identify vehicles entering or exiting the parking lot. Finally, an
evaluation of its usability was carried out both from the customer's side and from the
company's side with expert and participant based evaluation methods. The results show that
the application can significantly improve the process of finding a parking space remotely and
support a business in managing its reservations and serving its customers.
